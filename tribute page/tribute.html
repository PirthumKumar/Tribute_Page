        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, which was then part of British India. He hailed from a well-off merchant family, being the eldest of seven siblings. From an early age, Jinnah demonstrated a strong aptitude for learning, which eventually led him to pursue higher education in law. At the young age of 16, he traveled to London to study law at Lincoln's Inn. Jinnah’s determination and intellect shone through as he became one of the youngest Indians to be called to the Bar in 1896.

           <br> Upon returning to India, Jinnah established a successful legal practice in Bombay (now Mumbai). His sharp legal mind and eloquence quickly earned him recognition, and he soon ventured into politics, where he would leave an indelible mark.</p>

        <h1>Political Career</h1>
        <p>Jinnah’s political journey began with his association with the Indian National Congress in 1906, where he initially worked to foster Hindu-Muslim unity. He believed in a united India where all communities could live together in harmony. However, as political tensions between Hindus and Muslims grew, Jinnah became increasingly disillusioned with the Congress's policies, which he felt were biased against Muslims. <br>
            In 1913, Jinnah joined the All India Muslim League, where he began to advocate for the rights of Muslims in India more assertively. His vision for a separate Muslim state began to take shape as he realized the growing need for an independent homeland for Muslims. This vision was formalized in the Lahore Resolution of 1940, where Jinnah called for the creation of Pakistan. <br>
            Jinnah’s leadership and determination were instrumental in the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. As the first Governor-General of the new nation, Jinnah worked tirelessly to lay the foundations of a democratic and inclusive state. His commitment to justice, equality, and the rule of law became the guiding principles for the newly formed country.</p>
